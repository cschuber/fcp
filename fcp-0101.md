# FCP 101: Deprecation and removal of 10/100 Ethernet drivers

Deprecate most 10 and 10/100Mbps Ethernet drivers and remove them before
FreeBSD 13.

## Problem Statement

Each network driver creates drag for the project as we attempt to
improve the network stack or provide new features such as expanded
32-bit compatibility.  10 and 100 megabit Ethernet drives are largely
irrelevant today and we have a significant number of them in the
tree.

For at least a decade, most systems (including small embedded
systems) have shipped with gigabit Ethernet devices and virtual
machines commonly emulate popular gigabit devices.  We wish to
retain support for popular physical and virtual devices while
removing support for uncommon ones.  With a few exceptions these
drivers are unlikely to be used by our user base by the time FreeBSD
12 is obsolete.

## Proposed Solution

We propose to deprecate devices which are not sufficiently popular.  This
will entail:
 - (August 2018) Send this list to freebsd-net and freebsd-stable.
 - (Before FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE - September 2018) Update the manpages and
   attach routines for each device to be removed and merge those changes
   to FreeBSD 12.
 - (One month after FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE - December 2018) Remind
   freebsd-net and freebsd-stable users of pending deletion.
 - (Two months after FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE - January 2019) Delete deprecated
   devices.

Through out this process, solicit feedback on additions to the exception
list and update this document as required.  For a device to be placed on
the exception list, it must be popular in applications where it will
continue to be used beyond the support lifetime of FreeBSD 12 (late
2023).

### Exceptions to removal

Device | Reason
-------|-------------------------------------------------
ffec   | Onboard Ethernet for Vybrid arm7 boards
fxp    | Popular device long recommended by the project.
dc     | Popular device for CardBus card.
hme    | Built in interface on many supported sparc64 platforms.
le     | Emulated by QEMU, alternatives don't yet work for mips64.
nfe    | nfe is a popular 1GB device in many Ausus motherboards
rl     | Popular in Acer laptops
sis    | Soekris Engineering net45xx, net48xx, lan1621, and lan1641.
vr     | Popular in many Asus motherboards.
xl     | Popular device for CardBus card.

Note: USB devices have been excluded from consideration in this round.

### Device to be removed

ae, bfe, bm, cs, dme, ed, ep, ex, fe, pcn, sf, smc, sn,
ste, tl, tx, txp, vx, wb, xe

## Final Disposition
